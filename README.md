# Survey: Mental health in academia
### Tl:Dr
During the last years, people have started to give more and more attention to testimonies from PhD students and early-career researchers (ECRs) about the mental health problems they face due to working in academic settings. Of course, it is important to understand what the nature of these mental health issues is to foster healthier and more secure work environments. However, the magnitude of the issue is much wider, because problems such as anxiety, depression, sexual harassment, bullying, mobbing, mentoring problems, exploitation, and discrimination can have a serious impact on the creation and communication of scientific knowledge. Even when people realise the importance of the matter, there’s a lack of empirical data regarding these issues. Our project aims to (i) collect qualitative and quantitative data (e.g., narratives) about mental health related-issues in academic settings to gain a better understanding of how they affect PhD students and ECRs and what strategies they use to cope with them, and (ii) to explore what is the extent of the relationship between mental health and open science. Ultimately, we seek to raise awareness about the importance of mental health in academic settings and help to build a better academia.

### Extended Version:
Open Science aims at making all the processes and products of scientific research available and accessible for everyone, at all times, without barriers. It’s about democratising the outcomes of the scientific work to favour social well-being and engagement. In the last year, some people have posted testimonies on social media (i.e., blogs, Twitter, Facebook) explaining how issues such as anxiety, depression, sexual harassment, bullying, mobbing, mentoring problems, exploitation, and discrimination can have a huge impact on the communication of scientific knowledge. For instance, discrimination might well render a research team member less productive (reducing the social impact of his/her research), and an unhealthy relationship with a supervisor can sway the number and type of publications a person submits (for example, preventing him/her from publishing preprints or datasets in open repositories). However, there’s a lack of empirical data regarding these issues. One innovation of our study is that the analysis of data will not follow the typical qualitative/quantitative approach, but will include new analytical strategies, such as text mining. 

## Aims
- To collect qualitative and quantitative data (e.g., narratives) about mental health related-issues in academic settings.
- To post some of those experiences to a Twitter account, anonymously, to support others and raise awareness.
- To analyse the gathered data using a variety of approaches (including natural language text mining strategies).
- To gain a better understanding of how mental health-related issues affect PhD students and ECR in their academic settings.
- To identify what are the preponderant mental health issues affecting participants. 
- To identify strategies participants put into practice to cope with these issues.
- To explore what is the extent of the relationship between mental health and open science.
- To raise awareness about the importance of mental health in academic settings.
- To publish the results (e.g., papers, reports, oral presentations, infographics).
